# React based Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This is a simple React based tic tac toe project. It contains the following features:

- Editing Player Names
- Logs of each move below the gameboard
- Different game over pop ups for when there is a winner & for draws

It allows you to, well, play tic tac toe!

It helps demonstrate two essential components of the React philosophy, namely two way binding & the concept of states.

Attached below are the screenshots of the app:
